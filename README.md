# Corey Ladovsky Portfolio

Hello and welcome to my Portfolio! Here is a [Live Link](https://coreyladovsky.com/) to learn all about me.


### The Technologies:
This app was designed mobile first, and is completely responsive.
This app is made with React and JavaScript. I am also working with HTML5 and CSS3 Grid for styling purposes.
This app utilizes the [JQuery](https://jquery.com/) library for ease of manipulating the dom.
I also used [create react app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to help build this quick.
I'm using [React Slick](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-slick) for my photo carousel on the about me page.


### The Future:
Use my own photo carousel instead of a package.
Add a bonus material section to learn about my other interests.
Cross browser improvements.
More projects!
